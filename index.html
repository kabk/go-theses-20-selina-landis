                What ways of learning does collaboration generate? Can it become a safe space for creating work that is immune to competition? And finally, were do we learn to collaborate?

              This spring, when I applied for internships, one studio wanted to point out that they had seen many of my works on the website of a classmate of mine that had applied at their office, too. They mentioned that they understand that as
              students one does engage in a lot of collective projects. But during this conversation my interlocutor kept a smirk on his lips as he asked how I feel about it.
              Did he mean that the works in my portfolio are only 50% mine since they were joint efforts and therefore my skills were only half accountable? This thought confused and angered me, of course also arising from personal doubts regarding
              my own skills as aspiring designer.
              <br><br>
              Herein lies the paradox: the ability to work within a team is definitely a 21 century skill — it is listed in nearly every job requirement and I usually mention it as reason 'why you should hire <em>me</em>'.
              <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
              On the other hand in a world mostly run with the idea of capitalism individualism and competition are accelerated. I identify with my work, and feel that I am my work, so every professional failure also becomes a personal one — by not
              producing individual works I
              could be perceived as not having an own opinion (and we know it’s the highest crime as an art student) why would I even be a designer? Every time I am part of collaborations I am amazed anew of the taken path and obtained results. This
              surprise about the final outcome is for sure one of the main thrills for me. There seems to be a portion of magic to it, that is, guess, the essence of synergy. Depending of my degree of involvement I can recognize bits of my own
              aesthetics and
              choices, altered and combined with those of others. Is this how parents look mesmerized at their offspring? Recognizing personality traits and nose curvatures of their own or the partner and then wondering how that curly hair came
              about? And why is it more fun to make a collective brainchild?
              <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>

              Am I simply satisfying my need of collective effervescence?, that special feeling of connection with others — that we all long for as hypersocial creatures?
              <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
              <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>

              <br><br>

              The topic of collaboration seems to be on everyone’s lips: to talk about collaborations and the communities in which they take place is also to speak about inclusion and exclusion, institutions and a certain dominant culture.
              Collaborations have the potential to counter and reveal dominant (gender) regimes by 'generating solidarity among marginalized groups, and creating new spaces for experimentation that ignited cyberfeminism in the nineties' or lead to
              the emergence of 'commoning practices' out of discussions about sustainability. Projects like communal gardens, crowdsourcing, the sharing of public spaces and new forms of collaborating like co-working spaces all build upon the power
              of unity. How can this culture of sharing resist monetization?
              <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
              <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
              <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>
              As much as a collaboration challenges the way we relate to each other it’s success also depends upon it. Or as Claude Lévi-Strauss puts it:
              <br><br>

              <p class="tab"> 'In order to progress, people have to work together; and in the course of their collaboration they gradually become aware of an identification in their relationships whose initial diversity was precisely what made their
                collaboration fruitful and necessary.'
                <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p> What are those relationships today, what are the differences that hinder them?
              Where is all this communality and where is the space for diversity in them? The following listed situations exemplify what is meant by dominant discourses and how this oppress individuals and marginalized groups.
              <br><br>

              Adeola Enigboka reflects on the fear of difference and the fear of the stranger: she considers what it means to be a stranger (in the Netherlands) and how this consequently renders her an outsider. For her — a non white woman — to
              become
              appropriate and to integrate to Dutch culture ( to become part of the 'us') and it’s spaces such as the cafe mentioned in A Note on Gezelligheid she has to succumb a stereotyped, narrow role.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>
              <br><br>
              FKA Twigs explanation on her last production reveal some of the obstacles and issues around authorship and western though as a culture that excludes differences and singles out certain people. Her album Magdalene deals with her
              experience
              as woman defined and diminished by patriarchy.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>
              FKA Twigs sees this figure (Magdalene) as a male projection, and believes it is the moment when the patriarchy took control of the way women are told. It seems absurd to define a woman by the
              male figures that accompanied her, and so the well known name of Nicolas Jaar that co sign tracks on the album (along with other well known artists) does not figure on the record, because there is no writing. It was Nicolas Jaar that
              suggested it to Twigs:
              <br><br>
              <p class="tab">'He told me that putting his name on it wouldn't stress all my work, especially as a woman and producer. When he told that, I started crying.” She further points put that “We live in an age obsessed with superheroes,we
                are full of huge franchises that make fantastic films. (…) but in this picture strength and vulnerability never coexist.'<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
              In this case openly “declaring” the collaboration would have possibly belittled her part in the endeavor. As the public does not seem to be ready to accept a woman succeeding in a industry run by man.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12"
                  rel="footnote">12</a></sup>
              This years Turner Prize winners wanted to set a strong message by hijacking and exposing the dynamics this culture of winning (and exclusion).
              <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>
              For the first time since it’s establishment in 1984, the award goes to all four final
              nominees
              after they wrote a joint letter to the committee. Oscar Murillo, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock and Tai Shani wanted to set a sign for 'commonality, multiplicity and solidarit' by turning themselves into a collective in a time of
              'political division in Britain and conflict in much of the world'. Social and participatory practice is common to all of the four artists that believe that if taken together such practices discord with a competitive setting that
              classifies
              and individualizes. They further state <br><br>
              <p class="tab">'Placing in contention the issues in our work would undermine our individual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from
                capitalism.'<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

              The second two affairs testimony how people try to criticize and alter a structure and institution from within in and do not conform to it’s standards and requirements — but had to make it to this position to be actually heard.
              Collectives
              can also be a method for underrepresented groups to counter the status quo from outside: the Black Panther Party (initially Black Panther Party for Self-defense) radically aimed for political and economic power (and to be granted the
              same
              rights as white citizens) for African Americans through social force.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>
              <br><br>
              The diverse forms and goals of collaborations allow for taking big leaps in exploring the matter: my entry point into the topic was a particularly fruitful exchange with my classmate Seojeong Youn. With each shared project I got hyped
              in the potential of mixing, exchanging, matching, translating and colliding thoughts. Now there are many reasons why I prefer a joint effort above a single one, but the almost inexistent number of graduation projects by teams in our
              department shows another mindset. What are the reasons against it? Is it the uncertainty of succeeding? Engaging in a collaboration can be an adventure, even more if it is cross-disciplinary, and the pressure for a result is often more
              oppressing than the actual workload. Maybe students shy away from it to eliminate the possibility of someone fucking up their final project. Maybe some see graduation as a last possibility to do a project without restrictions and
              compromises: thinking of the long future of inevitable collaborations with clients that the profession will bring about anyways. Proving one’s uniqueness in the chosen topic. When did the idea of the artist as genius come up? Or the
              star-architect, or the author designer? Collaboration has always been a tool for big artworks, but only the idealized and romanticized figure of the gifted artist was credited for it.
              The following chapter is an inquiry into this system were I become an entrepreneur that constantly pursues. How can we overcome these notions? Can collaboration become a safe space in order to focus on the work itself instead of the
              outcome or the product?

              Teamwork, Collaboration, Cooperation and Coordination often are used interchangeably but a distinction is made when used within todays workplace context. In this setting it is important to be aware of this nuance, mainly to clarify the
              hierarchy of everyone involved, since wrong expectations can cause tensions between the involved parties and eventually affect the final outcome. Teamwork as defined by wikipedia is “the collective effort of a group towards a common
              goal or to compete a task in the most efficient way.” In this optic, “collaboration, cooperation and coordination” all happen within teamwork. But there is a ulterior difference between individually doing something within group or
              “together”. Collaboration means working together to create something new in support of a shared vision, the key points are that it is not through individual effort, something new is created, the common vision is the glue, and also,
              contrary to teamwork where everyone performs an individual task and team members don’t necessarily need to get along with each other, in a collaboration decisions are taken collectively and the managerial hierarchy tends to be flat:
              everyone is equal.
              We could settle with this definition, but it is a narrow vision on collaboration, one reduced to office settings and characteristic to our economic systems. At a closer look things are more intricate than this. Forms of collaboration
              are so variegated from size, composition and aim that the conceptualization around this topic seems endless. People (and some other forms of life) all want and have to collaborate. Many endeavors became to complex to be managed by one
              single person, and with the strive for growth, innovation and inclusiveness we reach out for skills and viewpoints that we lack. Collaborating allows to consider one idea from multiple sides and this inclusion enriches the result, and
              so, even if finally I have typed and compiled this very text myself, I rely on other peoples thoughts for it . Let me borrow the following sentence from David Bohm: “The collective thought is more powerful than the individual thought.
              In fact, the individual thought is mostly the result of collective thought and of interaction with other people. The language is entirely collective, and most of the thoughts in it are. Everybody does his own thing to those thoughts —
              he makes a contribution. But very few change them very much.”
              Alicia P. Melis researches how human ability to collaborate and share resources might impacted “the success of our species”. Psychological process behind our cooperative behavior is studied though children and primates. For mutually
              beneficial collaboration, individuals need cognitive mechanisms to coordinate actions with others and mechanisms to distribute the acquired resources in a way that convinces partners to continue collaborating. Chimpanzees seem to the
              first, but do not share as much the resources of joint labour. So whilst our ability as humans to communicate and collaborate is beyond that of animals, we do not employ them as easily and naturally as it might seem from Aristoteles
              thought. We engage in acts of cooperation primarily toward our inner circles, but do so at the expense of people outside of those circles. In support of this phenomenon, the hormone oxytocin, long considered the social hormone and
              playing a big role in formation of social bonds, has been shown to facilitate affiliation toward one's ingroup, but can increase aggression and defense toward one's outgroup.
              There are as many definitions and distinctions for collaborations, as there
              are frameworks within each, and this might be the reason why it quickly becomes exhausting to read theories about it. A collaboration is defined as a situation, so theories on it are the attempt to abstract it, and consider all the
              circumstances
              that make it up. This gives a multitude of possible collaborations and shows it’s idiosyncratic nature.

              Everything in a collaboration seems delicate, hard to grasp and still so impactful.
              In Introducing the theory of collaborative advantage the writers point out at some of the above mentioned circumstances that can overlap and cross relate. Identity, culture, power, working processes (…) represent potential tensions in
              a group, demonstrating the complexity of this situations.
              An example on how quickly the topic becomes slippery and how numerous the obstacles of success are arises when analyzing the basic definition “Collaboration is the situation were two or more work together to create or achieve the same
              thing”, judging by this the common aim seems a core reason for people to join forces and clearly defining, agreeing or sharing those aims is essential to make any joint progress for partners . The belief of coinciding goals is
              paradoxical in itself when one prevailing “strategy” for achieving advantage is collaborating with a people with complementary skills. This differences in experiences, expertise and resources also bring differences in visions and
              values and so it is not unlikely that the final aim differs. Agreeing that this is logic, or agreeing that we disagree, I still get frustrated (or disillusioned?) when the other person seems less involved. How can we harvest from this
              differences?


              Michel Serres was a philosopher know for incorporating numerous perspectives in his theories, an approach opposed to the critique or approval of ideas : “In philosophy as in life, and in life as in the sciences, I personally prefer
              invention accompanied by the danger of error, rather than rigorous verification paralleled by the risk of immobility”.
              Conversation plays an important role in his work as he believes that friendship and collaboration can invent new forms as long as the dialogue is not a “ a sort of fight to the death between two set opinions. Each participant in the
              conversation must be free and open.”
              When working with someone I usually keep a constant dialogue, this then facilitates decision making: everyone has to bee clear about what they bring to the table. Through vocalizing ideas get automatically sorted and tested by the
              interlocutor. Interesting thoughts get picked up and evolve quickly, less relevant ones get discharged, “darlings” killed if not valid. A constant reference of mine is Grapus, a graphic design collective that formed during the student
              revolt of 1968 in Paris and worked collectively for twenty years. Everything leaving the studio (mainly posters for cultural institutions) was signed collectively (Grapus). It’s members (at times around 20 people) all belonged to
              communist parties, and all their work was fuelled and dedicated to this ideology: for them, culture had to be brought to politics and politics to culture. They practiced creative conflict “We are in conflict with the clients, but there
              is also conflict between us. Everyone can talk about and work on everyone else’s project.”

              “And you, what do you do in life?” The question that quickly arises in any small talk, that makes me stammer or recite my script. I try to illustrate my days, hoping to earn approval because we are what we do. There is also the side
              job, “I’m reeally busy you know”, but it’s clear that it is a pure money-job, no further explanation, no shame, no pain… At least one aim we all share. With the other job? That’s were we all seek for personal, individual fulfillment.
              And if you don’t make it, you’re the one to blame.
              Above I speculate why students tend not to collaborate for graduation projects, suspecting that we all want to claim ideas and success as ours and to consolidate ourselves as capable and independent (and I am projecting my own thoughts
              here). Turns out our curriculum at KABK, as the majority of education models, makes use of a grading system, and this would be really hard to apply in at the case of two people collaborating for a graduation project. So even if the
              atmosphere between us is a collegian one and with considerably little competition we can’t ignore that we are all preparing for a future in an economy were we have to be, and mainly seem, better than others. Our education is modeled to
              prepare the individual and takes this for granted if I read though the regulations of the Academy. This legal setting is not made up from the institutional side but from law makers (for example the ministry of education) and if you are
              in the system you have to adapt to it’s rules.
              All this said whilst I am going back and forth between previously written parts of my Thesis and the progress of my classmates with emotional states ranging from slight to severe panic to reassurance or getting into a severely odd of
              being upset while seeing that in the previous year a student of the photography department graduated with the same topic. Mainly challenged to perform by expectations — whether they are mine or the expectations of the teachers which at
              this point seems hard to distinguish — I consider what it would mean to fail a project? And, why I barely allow myself to even contemplate this thought and it appears that we want to make it on our own.

              If collaboration indicates a situation, what are the circumstances it takes place in? How does our culture shape collaborations? And which kind of conditions and context would allow for collaboration to come to full fruition?

              “Individuals are responsible for themselves and have the right to become whatever kind of person they choose to be” is distinctively a twentieth-century belief, at least in western cultures. In her text Vera John Steiner tries to
              understand the psychological nature of collaborations, focusing specifically at small creative teams and on how their practices challenge mainstream theories focused on the individual. She introduces Jean Piagets and explains how he
              contributed to sculpt the idea that, in poor words, it is solely up to us to achieve our goals. His work on child development had a big weight on the idea that the individual self is the highest and most valuable element and this
              direction of thought was gladly welcome by western capitalist countries. According to Piaget, the role that others play in someones effort of constructing instruments for knowing and understanding the world is of support, each person
              “arrives at the pinnacle of mind’s power under one’s own command”.
              Friedrich Hayek, also considered as the father of neoliberalism, shares similar ideas, although of more entrepreneurial nature, he defines liberty as freedom of the individual to pursue their economic interests. I want to introduce the
              ideology of neoliberalism here to understand what Foucaults calls the "Entrepreneur of the Self”.

              Foucault deals with this subject in his course Birth of Biopolitics, where he presents the genealogy of liberalism and neoliberalism and how neoliberalism spread to domains that were thought to be non-economic, in particular to human
              beings. The "entrepreneur of the self" as the neoliberal subject (individual) is centered on itself, outside from the social field. It is the subject that acts upon itself to conform to the information of the market. The neoliberal
              subject is in constant adaptation and competition, proper to the power relations of neoliberal society, and disconnected from the social effects of his actions. I see in this subject the designer to busy to achieve success to question
              question approaches and commissions. The subject of the narcissistic designer is addressed by Erik Carter in his reflection on how todays majority of graphic design seems more concerned with personality than with content. He points out
              that designers feel that “they made it” when invited to give speeches on conventions. What actually happens is that they spend more time talking at events and less actually producing. Moreover this kind of event promotes people that
              are already established feeding the cult of personality. Füsun Türetken explained me how she sabotages this kind of dynamics by bringing along less known artists when invited for a talk, enabling them to access this spaces.  It is
              characteristic of the neoliberal subject that emotional relations and choices (of education and pleasure) are calculated as business investments. Each singular subject represents himself ideally as an entrepreneur (ultimately as a
              business brand). Competition generalizes to all aspects of reality. An example of how corporate identity is dominant in neoliberal market societies is the admiration of personalities as Bill Gates, worlds youngest self-made
              billionaire. Mark Zuckerberg’s fairytale, the studentthat changed the internet from his dorm, has ben turned into a film. The biography, rich in drama and denied by some of the portrayed characters, shows how a young man by working
              non-stop, dropping out of school for his visions, betraying a a close friend and getting sued for propriety theft becomes one of the most influential (and rich) figures of our times: the epitome of the radian hero.  Ayn Rand promoted
              her philosophy of Objectivism through her novels The FountainHead and Atlas Shrugged. Described by her as “the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as
              his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute”. In All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Adam Curtis explains how figures such as Howard Roark, the individualistic architect in Fountainhead that goes against the
              (architectural) establishment influenced ideologies of Silicon Valley. Rand states that individualism is superior to collectivism and altruism. How could a person that “respects the ability to do the right thing” ever be wrong? In her
              logic, the subject is responsible for their own pursuit of happiness, which in return means that the state has no responsibility towards the citizen either, which as one can see nowadays and in regard of the credit crunch in 2008 can
              result in catastrophic scenarios.  The so called “American Dream” deriving from this freedom influences pop culture and entertainment and this in return strengthens the dream, bringing people like J.Lo to pretend that they came from
              poor backgrounds “….Used to have a little, now I have a lot…” and making their success even more glorious. The original dream was luring for adults ready to commit themselves and take up some risk to secure the future of their next
              generation, the dream promoted lately is one more appealing to a never growing teenager. Martha Bayles points out that the “new” promoted dream is one for single, unattached young people seeking personal freedom, perfectly summed up in
              the sitcom of Friends. As by the creators, it is about “sex, love, relationships, careers … a time in your life when everything’s possible …”.
              Neoliberalism and individualism are intertwined in the sense that the first is a byproduct of the second, but also seems to enhance it as it spreads to all areas of our lives. Individualism stands for a society in which the ties
              between individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after himself or herself and his or her immediate family only. On the other hand we find collectivism: the term stands for a society in which people from birth onwards are
              integrated into strong cohesive ingroups (social category or group with which you identify strongly), which throughout people’s lifetime continue to protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty. This distinction comes from a
              Dutch organizational sociologist named Geert Hoofstede. Back in the 1970s, Hofstede did a extensive research for IBM of several hundred thousand of the company's workers in 70 countries, interviewing and creating surveys to understand
              behavior on the workplace and collaboration. Hoofstede created a “model of national culture” and distinguishes four factors that shaped business practices differently in IBM offices around the globe, the most famous of which became the
              spectrum between individualistic cultures, which emphasize a person's interpersonal, social, and civic connections. In countries with high individualism employees rather believe in individual decision making, training is most effective
              when not focused on group level and the employer/employee relationship is based on the market.  My point here is trying to understand what conditions, from educational to cultural, are shaping our perceptions and approaches to
              collaboration. The aspect of individualism of thinking critically and independently is needed also for a fruitful collaboration, but what does it mean for our practice if we are “entrepreneurs of ourself”: “being for ourselves our
              capital, being ourselves our own producer, being for ourself the source of our earnings”? Will it make it less likely for us to engage in collaborations? Under this light, the first precondition for a collaboration, the common aim, is
              nurtured by self-interest, decision making wether to take on shared working is based upon expectations about the future outcome. I would for instance evaluate previous behaviors and projects of this person to determine if together we
              would achieve success. In the circumstance of my personal graduation project I have high expectations for the outcome. This pressure to perform (that in this culture I place upon myself) makes it unlikely that I would take big risks. I
              think I am more concerned with passing the year and getting my degree than in freely exploring a subject without a vision of what my final product will be. This is how success is measured, this is how I can fit in. If I fail the blame
              is on me, not the institution. The neoliberal system of domination is not one of repression as Byung-Chul says, but one of seduction and desire. I am not oppressed worker, I am free to pursue my dreams and for that I have to compete
              against me and everyone else. There is little room for solidarity and communal spirit.
              We share and interact more than ever, but not for free: “The ideology of “community” or a “collaborative commons” leads to the total capitalization of existence. It makes it impossible to be friendly without a purpose. In a society of
              continuous, mutual feedback, friendship, too, becomes commercialized. People are friendly to get better ratings.”  Another core ingredient needed for collaborating in mutual trust, in Theorizing Collaborative Practice Huxham argues
              that partners need to trust each other enough for taking the risk to initiate the collaboration. The bigger the risk, then bigger the trust needed. But when can I build such trust if failing is not allowed? Personally I have the
              privilege to collaborate with whom I want and usually it is with friends (in certain cases I became friends by closely working together). I can rely on the fact that we both care as much for a project and, most of all, communication is
              very natural. Care, humor and trust appear as an optimal ground for ideas to bloom.

              In the previous chapter I try to understand what the nature of collaboration is in our current settings and how those compromise it. Here I want to introduce different situations and forms of collaboration and consider their aims or
              impacts, along I discovered more requirements for a functioning collaboration.

              Examples and inspiration for alternative ways of organizing can be found with bees and ants that distinguish themselves for their sociality. Eusociality, the highest level of sociality that a species can reach, is characterized by the
              division of labour into reproductive and non reproductive groups (sometimes referred to as castes), collective brood care and the multitude of generations of adults within a colony. In some cases this leads to the loss of one ability,
              for instance with certain bees were queens are sole reproducers (in collaboration with reproductive males…).
              Eusociality presented a paradox: On the Origin of Species, Darwin referred to the existence of sterile castes as the “one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory”. How could
              individuals incapable of reproducing pass on this sort of gene? He believed that the answer was to be found in the close family relationships which then W.D.Hamilton brought forward in 1964 with the inclusive fitness theory. It says
              that organisms can gain fitness (meaning reproductive success) not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also by increasing the one of other individuals that share their genes, especially their close relatives.
              What fascinates me is that this kind of altruism also secures a species.
              There are many organizations that look at the powerful collaboration of bees: The biomimicry institute was established in 2006 “to share nature’s design lessons with the people who design and make our world”, projects of this sort
              believe that nature inspired solutions will activate a new way of designing that is more careful of our resources and environment. Another project that researches the unique trait was initiated by management consultant David Zinger,
              philosopher and beekeeper Phil Veldhuis and artist Aganetha Dyck, their findings and fascinations are collected in Waggle a handbook to improve work, human organizations and engagement. What we learn here form bees is still useful for
              (management) economics: how to coordinate a group to maximize its productivity; or “how to get more from your employees than what somethings is referred to as the sum of their parts”. But I recon that this sort of techniques can
              generally be applied during teamwork, also among us students and open up ideas about otherness. In chapters with cringy titles (and explanatory pictures) like Go Girl and There is no “I” in bee Zinger looks at how most work in a
              beehive is done by females, suggesting that being more female in the way we collaborate can bring benefits. Wether women are more incline to collaborate or not is a whole other question, what I want to take from from here is the
              importance of hearing out peoples view on things.
              Still within the animal realm the octopus draws curiosity for being the only living creature having a decentralized brain. It is literally distributed across the eight arms, making them sort of thinking. The arms have autonomy and yet
              are still part of the body suggesting a system where power and control are not located in one place how we are used to. The invertebrate then furthermore surprises for being capable of remembering patterns, solving spacial problems and
              opening jars. Octupuses are genetically very distant from us and display a sophisticated and curios intelligence.


              How did animals end up in this text? Investigations of the sort manifest an urge in detecting different ways of relating to each other. One that is inclusive, where little bits still are part of the whole but were this unity does not
              erase the single.

              Psych et Po, a feminist current that began in France around 1968, was aiming at a collective force that wouldn’t be flattened by individualism. They developed a method to practice politics that was based on differences and turned them
              into it’s the very strength and attempted to rework fundamental structures of western society, language and political models. To become “one” in our culture is to reduce the female sex to the male. Psych et Po and the feminists
              practices that it influenced affirm sexual difference. If there are at least two types of being and not one (universal) the way for further ways of being is opened.
              From this many “practices of relation” derive, a way of doing collective politics and being together that does not demand for consensus and that.

              As put down earlier, collectives at times arise from the need of becoming visible in the social fabric. When joining forces succeeds it can be a method to escape ruling power structures by creating new environments for interactions. In
              history oppressed groups gathered to form movements and challenge or revolt against imposed codes. When social movements are formed and and begin to take action it is called mobilization, this term rightly brings warfare to my mind,
              since it describes the gathering of forces to go against opposing groups, rules, institutions… Alberto Melucci describes some of the factors that are needed for mobilization to occur: “a collective identity, the identification of an
              adversary, the definition of a purpose, an object at stake in the conflict.” He further stresses that it is not the poorest and most marginalized people that gather, but groups that already have experienced this sort of participation.
              Accordingly, women’s movement is a sort of offspring from civil right ant peace movements of the 60’s. These women were already part of this movements in a more subordinate role, but this experience nourished consciousness and thought
              capacity for action and organization.
              If people initiating the mobilizing process do it on the basis of previous experiences of alliance then it is comparable with a skill that has to be learned though personal involvement. Can I lean this in my surroundings, maybe through
              my education?

              WAYS OF LEARNING

              “A school is just a building with a school in it. It doesn't even have to be a building in the strictest sense. Take some of the school part out and it might work even better. “

              Doris Stauffer, swiss artist, educator and feminist, saw the necessity to combine the political with education. In 1969 she began teaching teamwork at the Zurich School of Applied Arts in the Farbe und Form (color and form) class.
              Believing that art belongs on the street, she and her pupils made banners and giant papier mâché dolls for FBB actions and moved the lessons into public space. Thus, she not only expanded the teaching methods, but also the common ideas
              of art education. She wanted to provoke, challenge, encourage critical thinking, and also question her position as a teacher. Teamwork was an attempt at collectivization, as a countermovement to individualistic creation. The school
              management did not approve of their teaching methods at all, the class was dissolved in 1970. Doris, her husband Serge Stauffer and their colleagues were fired, which led to protests among the students. The Stauffers left the School of
              Applied Arts and founded their own art school in 1971 together with Bendicht Fivian, Peter W. Gygax, Peter Jenny and Hansjörg Mattmüller: the F+F, Schule for experimentelle Gestaltung).
              It is at F+F that, at the end of the seventies, Doris Stauffer offered Hexenkurse,(witch courses), which were only open to women. Women should exchange ideas, share their experiences, get to know their own skills and try them out in a
              protected setting: “You are a witch when you are female, untamed, angry, happy and immortal.” The experience that her own artworks have been labelled as “Women’s art ” may have contributed to her coming up with this courses: it was
              about finding own opinions aesthetics and art, regardless of the art world dominated by men.

              Similarly idealistic and significant for many educational methods was the Black Mountain College, the experimental school active from 1933 to 1957. The college took inspiration from the Bauhaus model (many of the tutors were previously
              involved there) and the theories of education of John Dewey, so the belief in learning by doing and the Art as experience (opposed to the final product). The curriculum emphasized on artistic education and interdisciplinary and merged
              hands on projects, communal life and experimental practices to educate the students as a person and a citizen.
              One of it’s most important innovations so to say, that then influenced the Neo avant-garde movements, was it’s radical orientation towards collective and practical tasks (primarily everyday physical tasks to support the life on
              campus). The college was established to loosen conventional models between the students of a faculty and it’s administration; which usually served to specialize roles and strengthen hierarchies.
              The communal life did not follow a set structure, students had to question and co create societal living on campus in dialogue with each other. Roles such as student and teacher were examined as they unfolded, now understood as a
              performative acts, allowing the shaping of this roles.
              The forms of collaboration on campus often unfolded as experiments, it involved risk taking and was very energy consuming for participants. It was a process of trial and error, negotiation and changeover, and several disciplines could
              interplay. The possibility for failure was vital and empowering, because it shifted the focus from finalized art to the process, it’s energy and possibilities . The experiments were revealing what Deleuze called The cleavage of
              Casualty, a sort of elaboration on action and reaction, a laboratory for experiences to figure out the incomplete the ephemeral and the eventuality in situations. The idea that one should should approach art without an expectation of
              its end is very present in Jhon Cages work that had a big influence on the Fluxus movement of the 60ies and 70ties.

              The 2018 edition of the Design Biennale in Istanbul had the title School of Schools wanted to ask “ if can design and design education can provide the critical ideas and strategies needed to face future challanges” (from information
              overload to resource scafrcity). Also Isabelle Stenger urges that education needs to be rethought, a pretty legitimate plea, considering that our generation will have to solve it all…
              Similarly BAK, Basis voor actuele kunst (Utrecht) engages in projects (and seminars) that questions public institution (with the aim to improve it), wondering how it’s borders can be kept flexible, critical and non institutionalized by
              falling in the “best practice” model.

              Lychens don not need much: they can grow under extreme conditions and survive were it would not be possible for one of the symbiotic members alone. They are often among the first organisms to “colonize” new ground: they can grow on
              bare rock and even break it down with acids creating soil for plants. The algae helps the fungus and the fungus supports the algae, together the make new ground.

              My curiosity for collaborations sprang from personal experiences. Work process and outcome felt different: freed from expectations and self promotion. Strangely in control and yet very fluid and undefined — an open process of
              exploration and learning.
              Across the entire text the focus was mainly on western culture and how it shapes collaborations. Many obstacles were hidden behind this ideology, so deep it is infiltrated in our relationships, thoughts and institutions. I found out
              that collaborations have the potential to reveal this structures and eventually also to counter them.
              With this thesis I learned how collaborations can be a safe space for exploration and a way to restructure and rethink production also beyond graphic design. Educational models like those of Black Mountain College and F+F have intended
              to push this boundaries from within by questioning their own role in education. They were spaces for experimentation on production, the way we learn and connect with each other. There is a necessity for connecting and organizing
              differently with people (and we might just get inspired by bees and squids). There also is a need for spaces that allow and facilitate us in learning this and I want education to have this function for me. Collaborations ideally
              maintain things dynamic and therefore bring along the necessary flexibility to write inclusive solutions.
              The feminist politics developed by Psych et Po (and other collectives after them) is based on the theory of sexual difference, at it’s core lies the importance of doing things together and engaging with each other and building on
              differences. This ideas of explicit inclusion of the other also resonate with Xenofeminism, its manifesto combines alters and resurrects ideas from other fields and movements (and invests us to do so as well) such as cyberfeminism.
              This politics of difference need to be adopted and transferred in other contexts for creating connections and solidarity among single people, shaping our relations and fostering a culture of support.
